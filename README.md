# Lunar Lists
### A to-do list website
Lunar lists allows users to create to-do lists for any task with the addition of a fun and friendly space theme. Whether you are a busy person, or a forgetful one, you can use lunar lists to log all your tasks, set their due date, and mark them as completed when they're done. Your lunar lists are only available to you, so don't worry about people tampering with your lists.

## Testing
### Responsiveness

### Validation
#### CSS
I tested the CSS using the [W3 CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Two parse errors were found relating to an embedded media query. The errors were resolved by moving the media query to a new line. Bootstrap was the cause behind all 434 warnings; these relate to vendor extensions and variables not being statically checked.
- Validator before and after fixing:

#### Python pep8
I tested every python file using [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/). Not many violations were found, except for the ocasional whitespace and line length.
- urls.py before and after amendments:

- I left the following pep8 violations in the settings.py as the code could not be made shorter for the AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS:
